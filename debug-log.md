#### Balance Scale Debug Log

11/24
- Behavior expected: Calibration of scale would be .5 volts to 5 volts
- Observed behavior: Incorrect voltage displayed on multimeter
- Hypothesis for mismatch: Wrong supply voltage given, 5 volts instead of 9 volts
- Test hypothesis: Used 9 volts for scale circuit
- Result: Scale came out to mostly correct voltage, 0.617 to 5 volts!

- Behavior expected: Calibration of scale would be .5 volts to 5 volts
- Observed behavior: Incorrect voltage displayed
- Hypothesis for mismatch: Weak connection of scale wires to breadboard (wires too tiny)
- Test hypothesis: Used terminal blocks to connect scale wires to breadboard
- Result: Voltage still not reacting
