Balance Scale Debug Log

Every time you run in to unexpected behavior in your project (a bug, a component that works differently than you thought, or something else), make an entry in your log. Describe the following:
In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected.
In a sentence, explain the observed behavior.
Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch: what part of your code or what part of your circuit is behaving in a way you don't expect?
Test your hypothesis: what action can you take you determine if your hypothesis is true?
What is the result of your test?
Repeat steps iii-v above until you resolve your "bug".
